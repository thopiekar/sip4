Description: Python/C++ bindings generator runtime library
 SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes with some ideas
 borrowed from SWIG, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
 specificity towards C++ and Python.

Description: Python/C++ bindings generator runtime library (debug extension)
 SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes with some ideas
 borrowed from SWIG, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
 specificity towards C++ and Python.

Description: Python/C++ bindings generator development files
 SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes with some ideas
 borrowed from SWIG, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
 specificity towards C++ and Python.
 .
 SIP was originally designed to generate Python bindings for KDE and so
 has explicit support for the signal slot mechanism used by the Qt/KDE
 class libraries.
 .
 Features:
     - connecting Qt signals to Python functions and class methods
     - connecting Python signals to Qt slots
     - overloading virtual member functions with Python class methods
     - protected member functions
     - abstract classes
     - enumerated types
     - global class instances
     - static member functions.
 .
 This package contains the code generator tool and the development headers
 needed to develop Python bindings with sip.
