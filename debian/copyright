 As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
 part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
 parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
 as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
 the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
 special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
 Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
 License without this special exception.
